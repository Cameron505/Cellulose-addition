,"Analytical methods: All analytical methods use standard curves with the same matrix as the samples they are being compared against (Either water, 0.5 M potassium sulfate, or 2 M potassium chloride). All curves are made starting with HPLC water. All wavelengths are read on the Bio-Tek Synergy HT microplate reader (Bio-Tek Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) using the software package GEN5. ",

In short, 100 µL of sample was pipetted in triplicate with 100 µL working reagent (combination of sulfanilamide,N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, and Vanadium (III) Chloride) , incubated for 4 hours, and then read on the plate reader at a wavelength of 540nm. Two main curves are used in this assay a high curve 0-5 ppm-N and a low curve 0-2 ppm-N. (Doane, T.A. and W.R. Horwáth, Spectrophotometric determination of nitrate with a single reagent.

Two main curves are used in this assay a high curve 0-5 ppm-N and a low curve 0-2 ppm-N. (Rhine, E., et al., Improving the Berthelot reaction for determining ammonium in soil extracts and water.

Phosphate,"Phosphate concentrations were determined in all extractions and pore water using a colorimetric based microplate assay.

The curve ranges from 0-1 ppm-P. (D'Angelo, E., J. Crutchfield, and M. Vandiviere, Rapid, sensitive, microscale determination of phosphate in water and soil. Journal of environmental quality, 2001. 30(6): p. 2206-2209.)",
Total free primary amine (TFPA),"TFPA concentrations were determined in all extractions and pore water using a Fluorometric based microplate assay. In short, 50 µL of sample was pipetted in triplicate with 100 µL working reagent (potassium tetraborate + sodium hydroxide, o-phthaldialdehyde + ?-mercaptoethanol ), incubated for 1 hours, and then read on the plate reader at excitation 360 nm and emission of 460 nm. The curve ranges from 0-20 µM leucine. (Jones, D.L., A.G. Owen, and J.F.

Total reducing sugars (TRS),"Total reducing sugar concentrations were determined in all extractions and pore water using a colorimetric based microplate assay. In short, 25 µL of sample was pipetted in quadruplicate with 125µL working reagent (para-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide dissolved in hydrochloric acid and trisodium citrate + calcium chloride + Sodium hydroxide) , incubated at 100 °C  for 5 minutes, and then in an ice bath for another 5 minutes. Then read on  the plate reader at a wavelength of 410 nm. Two main curves are used in this assay a high curve 0-200 ppm glucose and a low curve 0-35 ppm glucose. (Lever, M., Colorimetric and fluorometric carbohydrate determination with p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide. Biochemical Medicine, 1973. 7(2): p. 274-281.;Fursova, O., G. Pogorelko, and O.A.

TOC/TN,"The K2SO4 extracts from chloroform fumigated and unfumigated samples were analyzed for dissolved organic C (DOC, using the N-POC method)) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) using a Shimadzu total organic C (TOC-VCPN) analyzer with a total nitrogen (TN) analyzer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Columbia, MD, USA). DOC and TDN concentrations in the unfumigated K2SO4 extracts were subtracted from the fumigated extracts, yielding an estimate of extractable microbial biomass C and N. Three chloroform fumigated and extracted blanks were used to account for any possible C or N contamination. Extractable microbial biomass is expressed as ?g (C or N) g dry soil-1 and is not corrected for extraction efficiency, which has not been determined in these soils. (Brookes, P.C., et al., Chloroform fumigation and the release of soil nitrogen: A rapid direct extraction method to measure microbial biomass nitrogen in soil.

Enzymes (Hydrolytic),Hydrolytic enzymes were measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl (MUF) and 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (MC) as standards and substrates- BG:  MUF-?-D-glucopyranoside; NAG:  MUF-N-acetyl-?-D-glucosaminide; LAP:  leucine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (hydrochloride); PHOS:  MUF phosphate,
Enzymes (oxidative),"To measure oxidative activities (PHENOX, PEROX) L-3,4-dihydroxypheylalanine is used as a substrate for both PHENOX and PEROX, and H2O2 added to PEROX plates. After 3 hours at incubation temperature absorbance at 460 nm wavelength was measured and compared with soil mixed with buffer only. colormtric and hydrolytic enzyme activities are reported in nmol hr-1 g dry soil-1. ",
Enzymes (Endo acting enzymes)," To measure the endo acting cellulases, EC and XC, assay kits were purchased, K-CellG5 and K-XylX6 from Megazyme, Irland and modified from Baldrian 2013 to run using microplates. This kit uses an azo-dyed carbohydrate substrates (carboxymethyl cellulose and birchwood xylan, respectively) In short samples were prepared in MUB solution, then desalted using the PD-10 desalting columns (Pharmacia, Sweden). By combining the desalted 150 µL sample with 50 µL substrates, and a standard curve of substrate mixed with active cellulases (provided in the kit, 150µL) after being incubated at 40 °C for 60 minutes the endo enzyme activity can be approximated by measuring absorbance at 400 nm using the HT plate reader",
Respiration,"A Li-820 infrared gas analyzer outfitted for static injections (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) next to the incubators was used for measuring respiration. ",
