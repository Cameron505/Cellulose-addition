# Cellulose-addition-incubation
Soil samples were collected along a treeline in northwest Alaska, in the western brooks range near the agashashok river. Roughly 60 5cm diameter cores were take between 10-15 cm (only organic horizon was taken).The soil was homogenized and frozen for shipment to Toledo Ohio. In Toledo soils were thawed, further homogenized and kept at 4 °C for roughly a week. Soil subsamples were placed in mesocosms and cellobiose, cellotetraose, cellulose-20, cellulose-90, and coloidal cellulose were added in equal amounts being careful to keep soil moisture constant. Soils were then incubated at -6, -2, 2 , 6, 10 °C for several months. During the incubation respiration was measured and at the end of the incubation soils were destructively harvested for K2SO4/FUM and MPLEx extractions, and sub samples were used to measure enzyme activity. Below is the data.
