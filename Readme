Arctic soil subsamples incubated at temperatures below freezing (-6, -2 °C) where microbial processes are known to be limited by low temperatures and ice but still active; just above freezing (2, 6 °C) where some microbial reactions, such as macromolecule depolymerization, can be temperature limited; and at 10 °C where the goal was to alleviate all temperature limitations to microbial decomposition and respiration. Different sizes of cellulose polymers were added, from dimers (cellobiose) increasing in size to microcrystalline cellulose.
